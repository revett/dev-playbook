# dev-playbook

[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook for macOS setup and
configuration.

## Install

Downloads and executes [`install.sh`](./install.sh) locally, which installs the
required dependencies for the playbook:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revett/dev-playbook/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Usage

Runs the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook:

```
make run
```

> **Note**: includes a step to install/update
> [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) dependencies.

### Running a Subset of Tasks

Filter which tasks within the playbook are executed via tags:

```
make run TAGS="homebrew,hostname"
```

## Manual Steps

Unfortunately not everything can be automated, so the following checklist
should be followed after running the playbook:

1. Configure iCloud settings
1. Install [1Password](https://1password.com/) via the App Store
1. Initialise SSH key
1. Initialise AWS credentials and profiles
1. Configure [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) to use `SauceCodePro Nerd Font Mono`
